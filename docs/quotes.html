        <h1>Motivational Quotes</h1>

        <h3>On Feeling Alone</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"The advice I'd give to somebody that's silently struggling is, you don't have to live that way. 
                You don't have to struggle in silence. You can be un-silent. You can live well with a mental health
                 condition, as long as you open up to somebody about it, because it's really important you share 
                 your experience with people so that you can get the help that you need." — Demi Lovato</li>
            <li>"I found that with depression, one of the most important things you can realize is that you're not 
                alone. You're not the first to go through it, you're not gonna be the last to go through it," — 
                Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</li>
            <li>"You are not alone. You are seen. I am with you. You are not alone." — Shonda Rhimes</li>
            <li>"The experience I have had is that once you start talking about [experiencing a mental health 
                struggle], you realize that actually you're part of quite a big club." — Prince Harry</li>
            <li>"Anything that's human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be more manageable. When 
                we can talk about our feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting, and less scary." — 
                Fred Rogers</li>
            <li>"There is hope, even when your brain tells you there isn't." ― John Green</li>
            <li>"Just remember, you are not alone, in fact, you are in a very commonplace with millions of others. 
                We need to help each other and keep striving to reach our goals." — Mike Moreno</li>
            <li>"The humanity we all share is more important than the mental illnesses we may not" ― Elyn R. Saks</li>
            <li>"Life doesn't make any sense without interdependence. We need each other, and the sooner we learn 
                that, the better for us all."  — Erik Erikson</li>
            <li>"Mental health problems don't define who you are. They are something you experience. You walk in the
                 rain and you feel the rain, but, importantly, YOU ARE NOT THE RAIN." — Matt Haig</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>On Continuing On Your Journey</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"You are the one thing in this world, above all other things, that you must never give up on. When I 
                was in middle school, I was struggling with severe anxiety and depression and the help and support I 
                received from my family and a therapist saved my life. Asking for help is the first step. You are more 
                precious to this world than you'll ever know." — Lili Reinhart</li>
            <li>"I would say what others have said: It gets better. One day, you'll find your tribe. You just have to 
                trust that people are out there waiting to love you and celebrate you for who you are. In the meantime, 
                the reality is you might have to be your own tribe. You might have to be your own best friend. That's 
                not something they're going to teach you in school. So start the work of loving yourself. — Wentworth 
                Miller</li>

                Lauren Fogel Mersy</li>
            <li>"My dark days made me stronger. Or maybe I already was strong, and they made me prove it." — Emery 
                Lord</li>
            <li>"Sometimes the people around you won't understand your journey. They don't need to, it's not for them." 
                — Joubert Botha</li>
            <li>"You don't have to be positive all the time. It's perfectly okay to feel sad, angry, annoyed, frustrated, 
                scared and anxious. Having feelings doesn't make you a negative person. It makes you human." — Lori 
                Deschene</li>
            <li>"This feeling will pass. The fear is real but the danger is not." ― Cammie McGovern</li>
            <li>"Your present circumstances don't determine where you go; they merely determine where you start." — 
                Nido Qubein</li>
            <li>"Tough times never last, but tough people do!" — Robert Schuller</li>
            <li>"Many survivors insist they're not courageous: 'If I were courageous I would have stopped the abuse.' 
                'If I were courageous, I wouldn't be scared'… Most of us have it mixed up. You don't start with courage 
                and then face fear. You become courageous because you face your fear." ― Laura Davis</li>
            <li>"I keep moving ahead, as always, knowing deep down inside that I am a good person and that I am worthy 
                of a good life." ― Jonathan Harnisch</li>
        </ul>

                Albus Dumbledore from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</li>

                Mokhonoana</li>
            <li>"Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves" ― Henry David Thoreau</li>
            <li>"I am not afraid of storms for I am learning how to sail my ship." — Amy March, from Little Women</li>
            <li>"Sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think, I'm not going to make it, but you laugh 
                inside — remembering all the times you've felt that way." — Charles Bukowski</li>
            <li>"Promise me you'll always remember — you're braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and 
                smarter than you think." — Christopher Robin from Winnie the Pooh</li>
            <li>"In the middle of winter I at last discovered that there was in me an invincible summer."  — Albert 
                Camus</li>
            <li>"If you're going through hell, keep going." — Winston Churchill</li>
            <li>"I am bent, but not broken. I am scarred, but not disfigured. I am sad, but not hopeless. I am tired, 
                but not powerless. I am angry, but not bitter. I am depressed, but not giving up." — Anonymous</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>From Celebrities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"Part of my identity is saying no to things I don't want to do… I check in with myself throughout the 
                day and I say, 'Do I really want to do this?' and if the answer is no, then I don't do it. And you 
                shouldn't either." — Lady Gaga</li>
            <li>"Everyone experiences a version of anxiety or worry in their lives, and maybe we go through it in a 
                different or more intense way for longer periods of time, but there's nothing wrong with you." — Emma 
                Stone</li>
            <li>"There isn't anybody out there who doesn't have a mental health issue, whether it's depression, anxiety, 
                or how to cope with relationships. Having OCD is not an embarrassment anymore — for me. Just know that 
                there is help and your life could be better if you go out and seek the help." — Howie Mandel</li>
            <li>"Mental health is something that we all need to talk about, and we need to take the stigma away from it. 
                So let's raise the awareness. Let's let everybody know it's OK to have a mental illness and addiction 
                problem." — Demi Lovato</li>
            <li>"Being vulnerable is actually a strength and not a weakness — that's why more and more mental health is 
                such an important thing to talk about. It's the same as being physically sick. And when you keep all those
                 things inside, when you bottle them up, it makes you ill." — Cara Delevingne</li>
            <li>"We would never tell someone with a broken leg that they should stop wallowing and get it together. We 
                don't consider taking medication for an ear infection something to be ashamed of. We shouldn't treat mental
                 health conditions any differently." — Michelle Obama</li>
            <li>"What I love about therapy is that they'll tell you what your blind spots are. Although that's 
                uncomfortable and painful, it gives you something to work with." — </li>
            <li>"Anyone can be affected, despite their level of success or their place on the food chain. In fact, there is
                 a good chance you know someone who is struggling with it since nearly 20% of American adults face some form
                  of mental illness in their lifetime. So why aren't we talking about it?" — Kristen Bell</li>
            <li>"I was with someone recently who asked: 'Well, don't you think that if you do too much therapy it will take 
                away your artistic process?' And I told them: 'The biggest lie that we've ever been sold is that we as artists 
                have to stay in pain to create.'" — Katy Perry</li>
            <li>"What mental health needs is more sunlight, more candor, and more unashamed conversation." — Glenn Close</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>From Therapists</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"Being able to be your true self is one of the strongest components of good mental health." —  Dr. Lauren 
                Fogel Mersy</li>
            <li>"No amount of therapy can or self care can make up for scarcity of food & drink, time, or financial resources."
                 — Whitney Goodman, LMFT</li>
            <li>"There is no cast, no scar, no stitches. No X-ray with the evidence of pain. Rarely is there physical evidence
                 of mental illness, but for those suffering from pervasive mental illness the pain and exhaustion is deep and 
                 heavy." — Emily Sanders, LMFT</li>
            <li>"You don't need to find a lesson in your trauma." — Jordan Pickell, MCP RCC</li>
            <li>"Just because no one else can heal or do your inner work for you doesn't mean you can, should, or need to do 
                it alone." — Lisa Olivera</li>
            <li>"We want you to know that you don't need to be in crisis or distress to seek help as going to therapy has 
                numerous benefits." — Carla Avalos LCSW+PMH-C</li>
            <li>"What if you moved through the world as if you were easy to be loved? Because I promise you, you are easy to 
                love." Sonalee Rashatwar, LCSW</li>
            <li>"Take a deep breath to remember you are the child who lived through survival mode and the empowered adult who 
                chose their healing." — Dr. Nicole LePera</li>
            <li>"'Positive vibes only' isn't a thing. Humans have a wide range of emotions and that's OK." — Molly Bahr, LMHC</li>
            <li>"No amount of support or generosity justifies someone treating you badly. This includes parents." — Sarah Crosby</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>On Struggling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"I don't regret opening up about what I went through [with depression], because, it sounds really cliché, but I 
                have had women come up to me and say, 'It meant so much to me.' It means so much when you realize that someone 
                was having a really hard time and feeling shame and was trying to hide this whole thing." — Winona Ryder</li>
            <li>"It's my experience that people are a lot more sympathetic if they can see you hurting, and for the millionth time 
                in my life I wish for measles or smallpox or some other easily understood disease just to make it easier on me and 
                also on them." ― Jennifer Niven</li>
            <li>"Change what you can, manage what you can't." ― Raymond McCauley</li>
            <li>"Because wherever I sat — on the deck of a ship or at a street café in Paris or Bangkok — I would be sitting under 
                the same glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air." ― Sylvia Plath</li>
            <li>"Mental health affects every aspect of your life. It's not just this neat little issue you can put into a box." — 
                Shannon Purser</li>
            <li>"Crazy isn't being broken or swallowing a dark secret. It's you or me amplified. If you ever told a lie and enjoyed 
                it. If you ever wished you could be a child forever." ― Susanna Kaysen</li>
            <li>"The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known 
                loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an 
                understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do 
                not just happen." — Elisabeth Kübler-Ross</li>
            <li>"The acknowledgement of having suffered evil is the greatest step forward in mental health." ― Stefan Molyneux</li>
            <li>"I knew well enough that one could fracture one's legs and arms and recover afterward, but I did not know that you 
                could fracture the brain in your head and recover from that too." ― Vincent van Gogh</li>
            <li>"We are not our trauma. We are not our brain chemistry. That's part of who we are, but we're so much more than 
                that." ― Sam J. Miller</li>
            <li>"If there is no struggle, there is no progress." — Fredrick Douglass</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>On Depression</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"The strongest people are not those who show strength in front of the world but those who fight and win battles 
                that others do not know anything about." — Jonathan Harnisch</li>
            <li>"Have patience with all things, but chiefly have patience with yourself. Do not lose courage in considering your 
                own imperfections but instantly set about remedying them—every day begin the task anew." —Saint Francis de Sales</li>
            <li>"The pain of severe depression is quite unimaginable to those who have not suffered it, and it kills in many 
                instances because its anguish can no longer be borne. The prevention of many suicides will continue to be hindered 
                until there is a general awareness of the nature of this pain." ― William Styron</li>
            <li>"So many people look at [my depression] as me being ungrateful, but that is not it — I can't help it. There's not 
                much that I'm closed off about, and the universe gave me all that so I could help people feel like they don't have 
                to be something they're not or feel like they have to fake happy. There's nothing worse than being fake happy." 
                — Miley Cyrus</li>
            <li>"There is so much pain in the world, and most of these people keep theirs secret, rolling through agonizing lives 
                in invisible wheelchairs, dressed in invisible bodycasts." ― Andrew Solomon</li>
            <li>"Others imply that they know what it is like to be depressed because they have gone through a divorce, lost a job, 
                or broken up with someone. But these experiences carry with them feelings. Depression, instead, is flat, hollow, 
                and unendurable. It is also tiresome. People cannot abide being around you when you are depressed. They might think 
                that they ought to, and they might even try, but you know and they know that you are tedious beyond belief: you are 
                irritable and paranoid and humorless and lifeless and critical and demanding and no reassurance is ever enough. 
                You're frightened, and you're frightening, and you're 'not at all like yourself but will be soon,' but you know you 
                won't." ― Kay Redfield Jamison</li>
            <li>"When you come out of the grips of a depression there is an incredible relief, but not one you feel allowed to 
                celebrate. Instead, the feeling of victory is replaced with anxiety that it will happen again, and with shame and 
                vulnerability when you see how your illness affected your family, your work, everything left untouched while you 
                struggled to survive. We come back to life thinner, paler, weaker … but as survivors. Survivors who don't get pats 
                on the back from coworkers who congratulate them on making it. Survivors who wake to more work than before because 
                their friends and family are exhausted from helping them fight a battle they may not even understand. I hope to one 
                day see a sea of people all wearing silver ribbons as a sign that they understand the secret battle, and as a 
                celebration of the victories made each day as we individually pull ourselves up out of our foxholes to see our scars 
                heal, and to remember what the sun looks like." ― Jenny Lawson</li>
            <li>"If you know someone who's depressed please resolve to never ask them why. Depression isn't a straightforward 
                response to a bad situation; depression just is, like the weather. Try to understand the blackness, lethargy, 
                hopelessness and loneliness they're going through. Be there for them when they come through the other side. It's 
                hard to be a friend to someone who's depressed, but it is one of the kindest, noblest and best things you will ever 
                do." — Stephen Fry</li>
            <li>"Feeling your feelings will not lead to depression." — Jordan Pickell, MCP RCC</li>
            <li>"…if you rely solely on medication to manage depression or anxiety, for example, you have done nothing to train the 
                mind, so that when you come off the medication, you are just as vulnerable to a relapse as though you had never taken 
                the medication." — Daniel Goleman</li>
            <li>"Depression weighs you down like a rock in a river. You don't stand a chance. You can fight and pray and hope you 
                have the strength to swim, but sometimes, you have to let yourself sink. Because you'll never know true happiness 
                until someone or something pulls you back out of that river — and you'll never believe it until you realize it was 
                you, yourself who saved you." ― Alysha Speer</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>On Bipolar Disorder</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"I could walk through fire if it meant making my dreams come true. That is the gift being bipolar gave me. It blessed 
                me with a lofty imagination, an iron will, and an unbreakable belief in the impossible." — AJ Mendez</li>
            <li>"It's possible to live well, feel well, and also find happiness with bipolar disorder or any other mental illness 
                [you're] struggling with." — Demi Lovato</li>
            <li>"One of the things that baffles me (and there are quite a few) is how there can be so much lingering stigma with 
                regards to mental illness, specifically bipolar disorder. In my opinion, living with manic depression takes a 
                tremendous amount of balls. Not unlike a tour of Afghanistan (though the bombs and bullets, in this case, come from the 
                inside). At times, being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so 
                if you're living with this illness and functioning at all, it's something to be proud of, not ashamed of. They should 
                issue medals along with the steady stream of medication." — Carrie Fisher</li>
            <li>"You are not your illness. You have an individual story to tell. You have a name, a history, a personality. Staying 
                yourself is part of the battle." — Julian Seifter</li>
            <li>"I'm not the kind of person who likes to shout out my personal issues from the rooftops, but with my bipolar becoming 
                public, I hope fellow sufferers will know it's completely controllable. I hope I can help remove any stigma attached 
                to it, and that those who don't have it under control will seek help with all that is available to treat it." 
                — Catherine Zeta-Jones</li>
            <li>"I am bipolar, and I am proud. And that is why I wanted to write a book. To shine a light on mental illness, to be 
                vulnerable about the days I let it take control and paid dearly for it, and to tell anyone fighting a similar 
                battle: You are not alone. You are not broken." — AJ Lee</li>
            <li>"My recovery from manic depression has been an evolution, not a sudden miracle." — Patty Duke</li>
            <li>"When under the strain of bipolar's strongest symptoms, we certainly can make selfish decisions, but that doesn't 
                make us selfish people. In fact, because we have struggled and known such depths of darkness, our compassion runs 
                deeper." — Lyss Trayers</li>
            <li>"Life is like a piano; the white keys represent happiness and the black show sadness. But as you go through life's 
                journey, remember that the black keys also create music." — Ehssan</li>
            <li>"Emotions, moods, impulses, ebb and flow with the tide of my life. Tidal waves, at times, in a bipolar mind." ― H.G.</li>
